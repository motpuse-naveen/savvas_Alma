                    <p>Tell students that writers choose their words very carefully in order to make their ideas clear and interesting to read. One way they do this is to repeat words or phrases. Explain that this is called <span class="bold">repetition</span>. Explain that writers use repetition for many reasons including, to create rhythm, to establish a certain mood or feeling, or to emphasize an important idea. </p>
                    <p>Remind students of “The Names Song.” Point out that the lyric, “I have a name and so do you. My name is special and yours is, too” repeats throughout the song. <span class="bold"> Ask:</span> Why do you think this lyric is repeated? What idea does it help you remember? <i>(That everyone has a name and that all names are special)</i> </p>
                    <p>Tell students that as they read this story, they will look for words and phrases that are repeated and explore why the author chose to repeat these words. </p>

                                <p>Alma Sofia Esperanza José Pura Candela thinks her name is too long. She tells her father it is so long, it never fits on a page. So, Alma’s father tells Alma the story behind her name. </p>
                                <p>Alma learns that each of her names represents someone in her family. Sofia was her grandmother, Esperanza was her great-grandmother, José was her grandfather, Pura was her great-aunt, and Candela was her other grandmother. As she learns the story of her name, she discovers various interests and attributes that she shares with each family member—a love of books, flowers, drawing, a sense of adventure, protection, and courage. </p>
                                 <p>In the end, Alma learns that her father picked the name Alma just for her so that she could make her own story. Once Alma learns this, she realizes her name is a perfect fit, and she becomes very proud of her very long name.</p>

                                    <span class="bold"> Family Stories</span> Family stories connect us to our history. Alma learns the story of her family by learning the story of her name. As her father tells her about the relatives she was named after, Alma gains a deeper understanding of and connection to the people who lived before her. Learning this history makes her feel proud of both her name and her family. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Family stories can also be shared through photographs, recipes, or other traditions that are passed from one generation to another. These stories help us to learn more about who we are and contribute to the development of our own unique identities.

                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Sensitivity Issues</h2>

                                <p>Before beginning the lesson, be sensitive to your students’ family situations, for example students in adoptive or foster families, or students who may not know specific details regarding their names. Modify activities as needed to support all students in participating. For example, if a student does not want to talk about their own name, suggest other names they can discuss such as the name of a pet, local sports team, or school mascot. </p>

                            <p>You might share situations in your life where your own pride or sense of self helped you overcome a difficult situation. For example, “When I was in fifth grade, classmates made fun of me because they thought my singing sounded funny. I ignored them and just sang louder and prouder!” </p>
                            <p>1.Now pose this question: Why might feeling proud of who you are help you deal with a problem like bullying?</p>
                           <p>2. Have students think about this question on their own, and then turn and talk to discuss it with a partner. Then, have partners discuss the question with the whole class. (Note that some students may not feel comfortable sharing experiences with bullying. In that case, they can discuss the question as it relates to the two videos that they viewed.)</p>
                           <p>3. Prompt the whole class discussion with guiding questions such as the following: </p>
                           <ul class="small-bullet">
                               <li>How does Faizah feel when she first hears the bully laughing at Asiya? Why? <i> (Faizah doesn’t understand it; she asks why; she can’t understand why others don’t see Asiya’s hijab the same way she does—proud and beautiful.)</i></li>
                               <li>How are Faizah’s reactions to the bullying different from Asiya’s? <i> (Asiya and her friends calmly go back to playing tag; Faizah gets mad)</i></li>
                               <li>What might Faizah learn from Asiya about dealing with bullies? How does feeling proud help both girls? <i> (Faizah learns to stay proud of herself and ignore the bullies. This helps both Asiya and Faizah let go of the hurtful words.)</i></li>
                                <li>Have you ever had to overcome a big challenge like this? How did it make you feel about yourself?</li>
